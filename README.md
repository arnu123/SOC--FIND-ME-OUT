# SOC--FIND-ME-OUT
This program has taught me a lot till now.
Starting with the basics of python, we moved on to some more syntaxes of python which were relevent to ML.
Then, in week 2, we moved to learning 3 important libraries of python namely, numpy, pandas, matplotlib which were actually little difficult to understand. Still I have tried to execute it.
Furthermore, in week 3, we moved to regression models, namely Linear regression model and logical model too. These provided good insights about how to handle data. These dived us deep into basic theoritical aspects of supervised machine learning and i felt it more interesting than python libraries though I understand both are equally important. Thus, i will be giving equal attention to all things in course.
